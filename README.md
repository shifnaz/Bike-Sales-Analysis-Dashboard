# Bike-Sales-Analysis-Dashboard

## Project Overview
An end-to-end data analysis project using a global bike sales dataset. I developed an interactive dashboard to visualize regional profit, product category trends, and seasonal performance.

## Technical Skills Demonstrated
* **Data Aggregation:** Used Pivot Tables to summarize millions in sales data.
* **Data Visualization:** Created multi-series line charts, stacked bar charts, and scorecards.
* **Data Quality Audit:** Identified and documented critical data gaps in 2014/2016 datasets.

## Key Findings
* **Market Leader:** The US market generates the highest profit ($10M+).
* **Product Strategy:** High-end Road Bikes ($3,578) drive the most significant profit-per-unit.
* **Anomalies:** Discovered missing reporting periods (July-Dec) in 2014 and 2016, which requires further investigation for accurate YOY comparisons.
